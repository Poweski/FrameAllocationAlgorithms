# FrameAllocationAlgorithms

We assume that there are a certain number (of the order of ~10) processes running in the system, each of them benefits
from its own set of pages (the locality principle still applies), the global reference chain is the result of combining the sequences
references generated by individual processes (each generates many of them, not one), pages are replaced
according to LRU, the system allocates a certain number of frames to each, based on the following methods:

1. Pro rata allocation
2. Equal allocation
3. Controlling the frequency of page errors
4. Zone model
